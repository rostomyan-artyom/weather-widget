# Weather-widget

Since the application does not imply the use of routing, I will do without vue-router

## Add your open weather api in /src/apiConfig.js

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```
